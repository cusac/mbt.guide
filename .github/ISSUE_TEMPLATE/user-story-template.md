This issue should ideally represent a small - medium chunk of work. If necessary, try to break the issue down into further chunks/issues and assign those as dependency issues. See this example:

If the issue is too complex, consider making it an [Epic](https://help.zenhub.com/support/solutions/articles/43000010341-an-intro-to-zenhub-epics)
