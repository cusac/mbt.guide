# mbt.guide

This is a web based app that provides a user friendly interface to view video content related to [MBT](http://my-big-toe.com).

It has a built-in tool for timestamping the YouTube videos.

## Development

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A brief tutorial on installing React is [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/install-react-with-create-react-app/)

You will also need a good IDE or code editor that has typescript syntax support and preferably intellisense, such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

With this development environment set up, checkout this repository to a local directory.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs dependencies.

## Running the app locally

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`
